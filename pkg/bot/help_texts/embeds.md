## Embeds
The bot can create self-updating code lists in "embed" format. One embed will only show active codes for one game. These embeds won't notify when they've been updated; that's the subscriptions' job.
- `/create_embed` - Create an embed for a channel.
- `/remove_embed` - Remove an embed by its message URL.

**ðŸ’¡Tip:** In an embed, you can click on the description of a code to launch the redemption link with that code filled for you!
