## Tickers
The bot can create self-updating code tickers. One ticker will only show active codes for one game. These tickers won't notify when they've been updated; that's the subscriptions' job.
- `/create_ticker` - Create an ticker for a channel.
- `/remove_ticker` - Remove an ticker by its message URL.
- `/check_tickers` - Get tickers created by the bot.
