## Tickers
The bot can create self-updating code tickers. One ticker will only show active codes for one game. These tickers won't notify when they've been updated; that's the subscriptions' job.
- `/create_ticker` - Create an embed for a channel.
- `/remove_ticker` - Remove an embed by its message URL.
